## Skin Cancer Detection Model using Deep Learning

## Description:

This Git repository contains the code and resources for a skin cancer detection model based on deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of skin images obtained from the HAM10000 dataset available on Kaggle.

The main objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify skin images into different types of skin cancer, including melanocytic nevi, melanoma, benign keratosis-like lesions, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, vascular lesions, and dermatofibroma. The model is designed to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, which can significantly improve patient outcomes.
